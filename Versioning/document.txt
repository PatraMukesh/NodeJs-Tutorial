🔢 Node.js Versioning: The Full Breakdown
📌 Version Format (SemVer)

Node.js uses Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
e.g., 20.11.1

Part	What It Means	                        Example
MAJOR	Breaking changes	                    20.x.x
MINOR	New features, backwards compatible	    x.11.x
PATCH	Bug fixes, small improvements	        x.x.1

📅 Node.js Release Schedule

Node has a regular release cycle, which includes:
Term	                            What It Means
Current	                    The latest, feature-packed release
LTS	                        Long-Term Support (stable for prod)
Maintenance	                Bug fixes, no new features


🚦 LTS = Use This in Production

    LTS stands for Long-Term Support

    Updated with security fixes & stability improvements

    Supported for ~30 months!

✅ Example LTS versions:

    18.x (Active LTS until April 2025)

    20.x (LTS from Oct 2023 → April 2026)

🛑 Avoid using “Current” versions in production unless you need a new feature.


📅 Node.js Release Timeline (Simplified)
Version	Status	Initial Release	LTS Start	End of Life (EOL)
16.x	Maintenance	Apr 2021	Oct 2021	Sep 2024 ✅ soon
18.x	Active LTS	Apr 2022	Oct 2022	Apr 2025
20.x	Active LTS	Apr 2023	Oct 2023	Apr 2026
21.x	Current (⚠️)	Oct 2023	no LTS	Jun 2024
22.x	Coming Soon	Apr 2024	Oct 2024	TBD


🧰 Tools to Manage Node Versions
1. nvm (Node Version Manager)

Install and switch between multiple Node versions easily:

nvm install 20
nvm use 18
nvm list

2. .nvmrc file

Put a file in your project root to specify a Node version:

# .nvmrc
18

Then:

nvm use

🔍 Why Version Matters

    Some packages only work with newer Node versions

    Older versions may miss ES6+ features

    Deployment platforms (like Heroku, Vercel) rely on correct Node versions

    Security updates are tied to supported versions


Best Practice:

    Use LTS for production

    Use nvm to manage versions

    Keep your .nvmrc and engines field in package.json:

"engines": {
  "node": ">=18.0.0"
}



🔢 Odd vs Even in Node.js Versioning

    ✅ Even-numbered Node versions (e.g., 16, 18, 20) → become LTS (Long-Term Support)
    🚫 Odd-numbered versions (e.g., 15, 17, 19, 21) → are short-lived, experimental, not LTS

💡 Why?

    Node.js follows a predictable 6-month release cycle.

    Every April, a new major version is released.

        That version is a “Current” release first.

    In October, if the version is even, it becomes LTS.

        Odd versions are never promoted to LTS and are dropped quickly.

📅 Real Examples
Version	Type	Released	LTS?	End of Life
14.x	Even	Apr 2020	✅ Yes	Apr 2023
15.x	Odd	Oct 2020	❌ No	Jun 2021
16.x	Even	Apr 2021	✅ Yes	Sep 2024
17.x	Odd	Oct 2021	❌ No	Jun 2022
18.x	Even	Apr 2022	✅ Yes	Apr 2025
19.x	Odd	Oct 2022	❌ No	Jun 2023
20.x	Even	Apr 2023	✅ Yes	Apr 2026
21.x	Odd	Oct 2023	❌ No	Jun 2024
22.x	Even	Apr 2024	✅ LTS in Oct 2024	TBD
🧠 TL;DR:
Node Version	What It Means
Even (16, 18, 20...)	✅ LTS versions — safe for production
Odd (15, 17, 19...)	🚧 Experimental — avoid for production



🔢 What are Alpha, Beta, RC in Versioning?

These are pre-release versions that come before a final stable release. They follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer) with special tags:

1.0.0-alpha
1.0.0-beta
1.0.0-rc.1

🧪 Versioning Stages (Explained)
Stage	Tag	Meaning
Alpha	1.0.0-alpha	🚧 First testing phase. May be unstable, incomplete, and buggy. Intended for internal or early testers.
Beta	1.0.0-beta	⚠️ More features complete. Still may have bugs. Released to a wider testing group.
RC (Release Candidate)	1.0.0-rc.1	✅ Almost final. Meant for final testing before stable release. If no major bugs are found, this becomes the official version.
Stable	1.0.0	🎉 Final public release, considered reliable for production.
📦 Example in a package.json

"dependencies": {
  "some-library": "^2.0.0-beta.3"
}

Means you're using the third beta release of version 2.0.0.
📌 Important Notes

    SemVer handles pre-releases with a dash:

    major.minor.patch-prerelease

    npm and yarn treat alpha/beta/rc as lower than stable:

        1.0.0-beta < 1.0.0

🛠 When should you use alpha/beta?
Tag	Should you use it in production?
alpha	❌ No — for early dev/testing only
beta	❌ Usually no — unless you’re testing new features
rc	⚠️ Maybe — if you’re testing before final rollout
stable	✅ Yes — ready for production
