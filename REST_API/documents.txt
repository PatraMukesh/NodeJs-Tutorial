🌐 What is a REST API?

REST API stands for:

    Representational State Transfer - Application Programming Interface

In simple words:

👉 It’s a way for two systems to talk to each other over the internet using standard HTTP methods (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
📦 Example in Real Life:

Imagine you have a mobile app that needs to get a list of users from a database on a server.

    The app sends a GET request to a URL like https://myapi.com/users

    The server responds with some data in JSON format

That’s a REST API at work!
🧱 REST API Basics:

A REST API:

    Works over HTTP

    Uses standard HTTP methods:

        GET → Read data

        POST → Create new data

        PUT/PATCH → Update data

        DELETE → Delete data

    Returns data in a standard format like JSON

    Each "thing" (like a user or product) is a resource

        e.g., /users, /products/123




✅ CSR vs SSR

These terms refer to how web pages are rendered and served to the client.
🔹 CSR - Client-Side Rendering

    The browser (client) loads a basic HTML file.

    Then it downloads JavaScript, and that JS renders the full page.

    Frameworks: React, Vue, Angular (by default).

    Pros:

        Fast interactions after load.

        Better for apps with heavy interactivity.

    Cons:

        Slower initial load.

        SEO can be tricky (since search engines see a blank page at first).

🔹 SSR - Server-Side Rendering

    The server generates the full HTML page and sends it to the browser.

    The browser just displays it.

    Frameworks: Next.js (React-based), Nuxt.js (Vue-based).

    Pros:

        Faster initial load.

        Better SEO (search engines can see the full content).

    Cons:

        Slightly more complex setup.

        More load on the server.
